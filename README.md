# collatz-be
Back end service for the collatz front end. Will work to update it as I get further along in my FSE class.

I know there isn't a solution, but it seemed like a really interesting thing to work with while attempting to learn javascript in my full stack development class.

This will handle the backend interface to save the numbers off, and eventually have a repository of every number calulated.
